## Authentication Service

### Implementation - ✅ Complete

The Auth Service has been fully implemented and validated. Components include:

- **User Entity** - Defined with all required fields and proper password hashing
- **User DTOs** - Created for user creation, update, login, and registration
- **JWT Strategy** - Implemented for token validation
- **Local Strategy** - Implemented for username/password authentication
- **Auth Guards** - Created JWT and Local guards for route protection
- **Auth Controller** - Implemented with login, register, profile, and token refresh endpoints
- **Auth Service** - Implemented with user validation and token generation functionality
- **Users Service** - Created with CRUD operations for user management
- **Events Service** - Implemented for asynchronous communication with other services via NATS
- **Health Checks** - Implemented to verify service status and database connectivity

#### Validation Results

All key endpoints have been successfully tested:

- ✅ Health Check (`GET /api/health`)
- ✅ User Registration (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- ✅ User Login (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- ✅ User Profile (`GET /api/auth/profile`)
- ✅ Token Refresh (`POST /api/auth/refresh-token`)
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Event Publishing (user created, updated, deleted, verified, password reset)

### Event-Driven Communication - ✅ Implemented

The Auth Service now implements event-driven communication using NATS for asynchronous messaging. This enables loose coupling between microservices and promotes event-driven architecture. The following events are published:

- **User Created** (`auth.user.created`) - Published when a new user is registered
- **User Updated** (`auth.user.updated`) - Published when user information is updated
- **User Deleted** (`auth.user.deleted`) - Published when a user is deleted
- **User Verified** (`auth.user.verified`) - Published when a user verifies their email
- **Password Reset** (`auth.user.password_reset`) - Published when a user resets their password

For local development, a Docker Compose configuration (`services/auth-service/docker-compose.dev.yml`) is provided that includes:
- Auth Service
- PostgreSQL database
- NATS message broker

To start the local development environment with NATS support:
```bash
cd services/auth-service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

#### Testing Commands

To test the Auth Service:

```bash
# Navigate to the auth service directory
cd services/auth-service

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the service in development mode
npm run start:dev
```

Alternatively, use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start the auth service with its dependencies
docker-compose up auth-service
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:3001/api with the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:3001/api/docs
